        <h2>Lesson 1: exercise 3: Objects</h2>
        <br>
        <a href="#" class=exercise-in>You already have a list of books available from books.js file object,<br>
        all you need to do is add them to your library.<br>
        This books object is pulled in from google books api, as you can see it<br>
        has a lot of information but this is standard when dealing with external APIs.<br>
<br>
        Open index.html and have a look what you have available.<br>
        By clicking left and right buttons you should be able to see the information about<br>
        each read book.<br>
<br>
        The infrastrucure of showing these books is already set up.<br>
<br>
        All you need to do is:<br>
<br>
        1. Create and array named readBooks, should start off empty<br>
        and eventually hold book objects. Each object should look something like this<br>
        it is important to name the keys as they are in the example below.<br>
        {<br>
            title: string,<br>
            image: string,<br>
            authors: array,<br>
            averageRating: number,<br>
            epub: boolean,<br>
            shortDescription: string - Only the first sentence of a description.<br>
        }<br>
<br>
        2. Create a function named read, this function should accept one parameter,<br>
        the body of the function should create a book object<br>
        and push it into the readBooks array.<br>
<br>
        Clicking each book in the Books list calls your read() function and passes a book<br>
        into it (already set up for you), this book item has a lot of information and we need to narrow it<br>
        down to only have the information we need.<br>
<br>


        Hint: most of the information is under volumeInfo key<br>
        Hint: some keys are not always defined, how do you make sure you will not end up with something undefined in your book object<br>
<br>
        Bonus: You should only be able to read a book once<br>
        </a><br>
        <p>My approach:</p>
        <a href="exercise3.html" class=exercise-in-sol>
          const readBooks = []<br>
          const getVal = bookProp => bookProp === undefined ? "-" : bookProp<br>
          const read = book => {<br>
            let readBook = {}<br>
            if (readBooks.find(rb => rb.title === book.volumeInfo.title)){alert("Already read");return}<br>
            readBook.title = getVal(book.volumeInfo.title)<br>
            readBook.image = getVal(book.volumeInfo.imageLinks.thumbnail)<br>
            readBook.authors = getVal(book.volumeInfo.authors)<br>
            readBook.averageRating = getVal(book.volumeInfo.averageRating)<br>
            readBook.epub = getVal(book.accessInfo.epub.isAvailable)<br>
            readBook.shortDescription = getVal(book.volumeInfo.description.split(".")[0])<br>
            readBooks.push(readBook)<br>
          }<br>
        </a><br>
        <br>
        <p>Test this solution:</p>
        <div class="test">
          <p class=output id=output>
            <a class=output href="carousel.html">Access the carousel page</a>
          </p>
